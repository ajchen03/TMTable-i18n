# ALRIGHT CHECK THIS OUT
You need to open this AS A SERVER to run! (I know, it's weird, but it's how it works)
For VSCode, you can use the five Server extension to do this.
For other IDEs... welp, you're on your own. GOOGLE HELP

# How to use this
Mostly just as you do a normal tree, but replace every strings with ```text()```.
You can get how this work by looking at [this](/js/langs/en_US.js) file.
You still need to write a welcome page like [this](/js/lag.js) file to make a OoBE "language selection".

If you in counter any issue, ping @ajchen on the discord server.

Go check [their own readme](https://github.com/shenmi124/The-Modding-Table) for more info i guess.
