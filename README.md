# ALRIGHT CHECK THIS OUT
You need to open this AS A SERVER to run! (I know, it's weird, but it's how it works)<br>
For VSCode, you can use the five Server extension to do this.<br>
For other IDEs... welp, you're on your own. GOOGLE HELP

# How to use this
Mostly just as you do a normal tree, but replace every strings with ```text()```.<br>
You can get how this work by looking at [this](/js/langs/en_US.js) file.<br>
You still need to write a welcome page like [this](/js/lag.js) file to make a OoBE "language selection".<br>

If you in counter any issue, ping @ajchen on the discord server.

Go check [their own readme](https://github.com/shenmi124/The-Modding-Table) for more info i guess.

<s>god damint why i still need to write ```<br>``` in readme.md</s>
